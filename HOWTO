unlocker.py script did not work (for me), but the code for unlocking device based on IMEI did.
Therefore the procedure to unlock huawei (Tested succesfully) was as follows:

1) Connect to modem (As root)
$ minicom -s

2) Configure
First thing is to change the port to /dev/ttyUSB0. So press A and change the /dev/tty0 to /dev/ttyUSB0
Next, we need to change the Baud Rate, paritiy and bits to 9600,N,8 (respectively). To do this, press E
Press Enter to complete the Serial port Setup.
Now select Exit to exit the configuration menu.

Note, this is Exit and NOT Exit from minicom option.

3) Test connection

If 1, cont

3a) run python in interactive shell, command after another
$ python
import hashlib

imei = "xxxx"

def computeUnlockCode(imei):
        salt = '5e8dd316726b0335'
        digest = hashlib.md5((imei+salt).lower()).digest()
        code = 0
        for i in range(0,4):
                code += (ord(digest[i])^ord(digest[4+i])^ord(digest[8+i])^ord(digest[12+i])) << (3-i)*8
        code &= 0x1ffffff
        code |= 0x2000000
        return code

computeUnlockCode(imei)
=> prints unlock code

or
3b) run simplified unlock.py
$ python unlock.py <imei>
=> prints unlock code

4) Unlock (at minicom session)
AT^CARDLOCK="unlockcode"
